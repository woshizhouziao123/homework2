(1) Give one example of each of the following type of data.

Answer:

(a) Analog:acoustic signal

(b) Digital: MP4 files

(c) Primary: data crawled from the Internet


(d) Secondary (i.e., lack of data that is informative):temperature data lacking time information

(e) Metadata:IMDB defines a set of metadata to describe each movie. The following is its primary
metadata: Cast and Crew, Company Credits, Basic Data, Plot & Quotes, Fun Stuff, Links to Other
Sites, Box Office and Business, Technical Info, Literature, Other Data.

(f) Environmental::Data on environmental quality, environmental pollution and its prevention,
ecological protection, nuclear and radiation safety, environmental management, and other
environmental protection matters, such as National Pollution Data.

(2) Write one example when the same structured data can be classified as (a) information, (b) redundancy and (c) not interpretable.

Answer:

Consider the game chairs in the game store, each chair corresponds to a price (no unit, all other
The customer defaults to U.S. dollars). When the same kind of chair product and its price are placed in two different
The location of the store, the price of a location:

(a) When the customer refers to the price of the location, it is classified as information.

(b) When the customer uses the price of the goods at point A, the price is redundant information Goods at B place are used as reference prices.

(c) When a new customer arrives at the store, I don’t know if it’s US dollars or The euro, which is classified as unexplainable data.

(3) Photo-voltaic generation converts the sun's radiation into usable electricity. In this task, you will get the direct solar radiation with 1 minute time interval from the Radiation observations at FMI. Plot radiation profile of three different days so that one must be in March, other in July and the last in December (regardless of the year). Provide information about the potential of solar generation in those days. You can also select the measuring station (but write it in the answer).

Hint: Code like in the tutorial notebook.

The more solar radiation, the more energy that can be converted into life. From the three-day solar radiation comparison chart in the figure above, it can be seen that the solar radiation conversion potential in summer (July.1st) is the highest compared with the other two days.




(4) Read the text Blockchains Use Massive Amounts of Energy—But There’s a Plan to Fix That. Write a brief analysis of the text based on the relation between data, energy and level of processes. Note: This is clearly not a right/wrong question, but a space to critically think about current issues related to the course.

Answer:
First of all, the mechanism for the security of cryptocurrency (that is, to ensure that the blockchain is
protected from attacks) is very complicated, which leads to a large amount of data exchange in the
operation of the mechanism. These data exchanges consume electricity through computers. In addition,
through miners Repeated attempts to sign will also generate a lot of useless data, and the generation of
these data will also cause additional consumption. Therefore, the consumption of power resources by the
blockchain is huge. Researchers are also looking for special methods to reduce power consumption.
In my opinion, blockchain consumes electricity, but it also creates a lot of value. In the global environment,
we cannot accurately predict the full impact of a technology on the world. Just like the blockchain
technology, perhaps it also has an impact on the development of new energy applications, so as the article
said, we have to look at this issue dialectically and critically
